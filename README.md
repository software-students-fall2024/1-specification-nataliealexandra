## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder: Carissa (24, recent college graduate)

#### Goals and Needs:

- Carissa likes to organize her study sessions with music that helps her focus.
- She prefers using playlists with calm music for deep concentration and upbeat music for routine tasks like cleaning, working out, and errands. Her ADHD can make it difficult to focus depending on the sounds in her environment.
- As a music lover, she would like a task management app that also helps her discover new music. Often times she goes to put on music while she is completing tasks but gets overwhelmed by trying to pick and choose new music.
- Additionally, Carissa needs an easy way to track both her tasks and her listening habits to understand which music helps her be more productive.

#### Problems and Frustrations:

- She often wastes time choosing the right playlist for different activities.
- Existing task management apps feel too cluttered or too plain for her taste. 
- Managing time for both studying and personal tasks can be overwhelming.
- She finds it hard to stay focused if the music is too distracting or repetitive.
